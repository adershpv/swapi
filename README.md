## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v7 or higher) or **yarn**

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adershpv/swapi.git
   cd swapi
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Key components and hooks are covered with unit tests.
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library are used.
- To run tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  # or
  yarn test
  ```

## Considerations for Scaling
1. **Maintainability**:
   - Components are modular and reusable.
   - TypeScript ensures type safety across the application.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The directory structure is organized for easy addition of new features.
   - Hooks and utilities abstract common logic, reducing duplication.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Clear separation of concerns makes it easier for multiple teams to work on different features.

## Future Enhancements
- **Backend API**: Implement a custom backend for additional features.
- **Authentication**: Allow users to save their favorites across devices.
- **Theme Support**: Add light and dark mode.
